Theory -
1. What is Emmet?
-> Emmet is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allow for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSLT, and other structured code formats via content assist. The project was started by Vadim Makeev in 2008 and continues to be actively developed by Sergey Chikuyonok and Emmet users.

2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
-> When using a framework, the framework is doing most of the work and there are particular places where you insert your code (for ex: In react you put your html (jsx) inside the render function). Framework usually owns the “main” function. In case of react render() is the main function.

So whenever the framework needs the application specific code it calls your code. So here the control is “inverted” from you to the framework. This is called inversion of control.

Conclusion: Library gives you a set of functions/modules/APIs which you can use to solve a certain problem, but it doesn’t change your code on the structural or architectural level. On the other hand, frameworks also give you a set of functions/modules/APIs but it does change your code on the structural or architectural level. Library - you call it, Framework - it calls you.
3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
-> CDNs cache content like web pages, images, and video in proxy servers near to your physical location. This allows you to do things like watch a movie, download software, check your bank balance, post on social media, or make purchases, without having to wait for content to load.

E.g. You could think of a CDN like an ATM.

4. Why is React known as React?
-> Jordan Walke, who is the creator of ReactJS, 
Jordan Walke: I might add for the sake of discussion, that many systems advertise some kind of reactivity, but they usually require that you set up some kind of point-to-point listeners and won’t work on structured data. This API reacts to any state or property changes, and works with data of any form (as deeply structured as the graph itself) so I think the name is fitting.

5. What is crossorigin in script tag?
-> Cross Origin in script tag is use to add Allow Access Allow Origin header which will allow browser to fetch data from the resource hosted on different origin.
-> The purpose of crossorigin attribute is used to share the resources from one domain to another domain.
    It is used to handle the CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) request that checks whether it is safe to allow for sharing the resources from other domains.

6. What is diference between React and ReactDOM
-> React library is responsible for creating views and ReactDOM library is responsible to actually render UI in the browser.

7. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
-> This two let us write React code in our JavaScripts
-> The versions above are only meant for development, and are not suitable for production.

8. What is async and defer?
-> <script async>
async downloads the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it when it has finished downloading.


<script defer>
defer downloads the file during HTML parsing and will only execute it after the parser has completed. defer scripts are also guaranteed to execute in the order that they appear in the document.
